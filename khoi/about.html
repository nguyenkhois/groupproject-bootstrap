                <p class="h2 text-muted">Empowering wellness professionals</p>
                <p>By choosing to have a therapist come to you, rather than going to a spa, you are playing a role in supporting a hard-working group of self-employed therapists. The therapists on the Urban Massage platform are embracing a new, empowering and flexible working environment. Being mobile radically reduces overheads rivalled to working at a spa, which often leaves therapists receiving less than 20% of the treatment price.</p>

                <p>Together, we are proudly revolutionising the way consumers access wellness when and where they want.</p>
